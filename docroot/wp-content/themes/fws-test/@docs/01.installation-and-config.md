# Installation and Configuration
> DOCS: FWS Starter _S

## Installation Instructions
Install FWS CLI globaly.

This only needs to be done once per machine, so if you installed it previously, skip this step.

Although, keep in mind for most recent version of it: [@fws/cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fws/cli).

    npm i @fws/cli -g

Install JS dependencies by running [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) package manager.

    npm install

Install PHP dependencies by running [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) dependency manager.

    composer install

Install [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/) WordPress plugin as the Starter Theme depends on it. Works better with PRO version.

## Starter Config

Use `.fwsconfig.yml` file to configure top level theme options.

### Global Config

- `theme-name` - set theme full name
- `recovery-mode-emails` - set the fatal error handler email address from admin's to our internal
- `prevent-plugin-update` - enable only logged in users with declared email domain to add/update/remove plugins
- `acf-only-local-editing` - enable acf to edit and manage only on local enviorment


    global:
        theme-name: 'FWS Starter _S'
        recovery-mode-emails:
            - 'nick@forwardslashny.com'
            - 'boris@forwardslashny.com'
            - 'petar@forwardslashny.com'
        prevent-plugin-update:
            enable: true
            domain: forwardslashny.com
        acf-only-local-editing:
            enable: true
            allowed-hosts:
                - '.local'
                - 'localhost/'
                - '.lndo.site'

#### Local Virtual Host

Local enviorment **needs** to be declared in an `.env` file in order for project to work properly.

`.env` file is on git ignore list, but there's also an `.env.example` file that should be cloned and renamed to `.env`.

With this in mind, every team member can be free to name their virual hosts whatever they want to.

    VIRTUAL_HOST_URL=http://project-name.lndo.local/

### ACF Fields Config

More details about `acf-options-page` and `acf-flexible-content` in the **Using Components** section, **Managing Options pages** sub section.

- `buttons` - set list of all buttons defining their classes and dummy text


    styleguide:
        pages:
            -
                title: 'FE Homepage'
                url: '/fe-homepage/'
        colors:
            - 'black'
            - 'white'
        icons:
            - 'ico-arrow-up'
            - 'ico-arrow-down'
        fonts:

                name: 'Open Sans'
                class: 'font-main'
        titles:
            -
                text: 'This is Page Title'
                class: 'page-title'
        buttons:
            -
                text: 'Normal'
                class: 'btn'

Styleguide page **will automatically load** any `_fe-` prefix files.

**This is why it is important to name any variation files using `--` extension to file name.**

For example:
- default file name: `_fe-banner.php`
- varitation file name: `_fe-banner--alt.php`

### Styles and Scripts Version

Note that after `fws build` the `.fwsenqueue.yml` file is generated.

This file is on `.gitignore` list and is generating a timestamp after each **build**.

This **timestamp** is used as a version control for compiled files, that is, for styles and scripts that are enqueued in the theme.
